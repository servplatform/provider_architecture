## Installation

- run `./format.sh` to setup git pre commit formatting
- run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` if you plan to add/change any serializers once
- run `flutter packages pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs` if you plan to add/change any serializers multiple times

## Adding support for another language

- Find the language local code for here [codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
- Inside of `lib/local_setup.dart` add the local code to `supportedLocales` and `supportedLocalCodes`
- Create a `<local>.json` file under assets/lang/ and fill out every value for your language
- Run `flutter clean` inside you lib apps directory if flutter complains
- There is also a different way to implement locals using the [intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl) package. An example on how to do so can be found [here](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/master/examples/internationalization/intl_example)

## Adding app icon

- Change icon `assets/images/logo.png` another image
- If new icon has a different path update `flutter_icons:` in the `pubspec.yaml` file
- Run flutter `flutter pub get` and then `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main`
